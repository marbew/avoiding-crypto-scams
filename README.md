Avoiding crypto scams like a pro

You start with a bag full of luck and an empty bag of experience. The trick is to fill the bag of experience before you empty the bag of luck.

Like dead aeroplane pilots, you won’t survive long enough by making all the mistakes they already made. 

If you are new or experienced in the crypto space, take a few minutes to read this, help yourself and the community around you to clarify what are the basic steps many people have learned so far to benefit from this incredible technology which touches nowadays mainly the finance space. 

There are many suggestions online, but here I want to add the things I wish I knew early in my early days. The topics below are just an open chapter for you to start exploring. Do not assume that because of 1 or 2 points are matching your search, you are dealing with a safe project. Do not consider all the points offered here as the solution for the perfect security approach or the best decision making approach which will keep you far from making any crypto mistakes, but you are on a safer path.

You avoided already all scammers – Crypto space, cryptocurrencies are extremely difficult to be understood with a 10 minutes reading, it’s like wanting to drive a car or build a house and you are only a 5 years old human being. You need time for studying it and digest it properly. Cryptocurrencies, crypto tokens are high lucrative vectors for those understand it, as demonstrated in certain phases of the past years. For this reason, humans sadly enjoy exploiting other humans. Crypto currencies and their mother, called mathematics, do not exploit humans, humans do. Criminality of all types exist since Gold, precious metal money and then Dollar paper money, have been created and sadly this will carry on with other type of money too. 
Humans looking to exploit naive, ignorant humans use these techniques for easy success:

    • Phishing Social engineers reach a user’s inbox with malicious links 
    • Giveaway  Social engineers’ most successful methods of theft in cryptocurrency scams.
    • Employment  Social engineers pose as recruiters, offering high-profile opportunities as a way to steal data
    • Remittance/Withdrawal Social engineers require users to send money in order to receive money
    • Romance Social engineers are online relationships that culminate with a request for crypto funds
    • Pig Butchering Social engineers are the sophisticated evolution of romance scams
    • Rug Pulls leave victims with worthless coins tokens or NFTs
    • Cryptojacking is a hack for mining crypto in favour of the social engineers
    
Everybody, after understanding these sad initial points and being fully aware of their presence, should now be ready to move on.   

Crypto tokens and crypto coins – Make sure you understand the difference between crypto token and crypto coin. We have already some form of money (fiat money: Dollar, Euro, Sterling ...), so ask yourself if the project you are researching is actually aiming to solve some important issue in the fintech space and in our society, if not, it could be another red flag. Usually any valuable cryptocurrency or crypto project does not need any commercial, promotion, affiliation, emails, SMS texts or phone calls by anyone. Have you ever seen Bitcoin or Ethereum commercials?

Do not trust, verify – This, summarises all the essence of this green field space of crypto. Researching is considered paramount and the points below will show you how to start with a basic / moderate due diligence. RIPCORD type blockchains are the ones able to verify for you your transactions. If the blockchain you are trying to operate / invest in, can not be categorised as RIPCORD, that could be a red flag, so you will increase scrutiny by researching deeper about it. RIPCORD stands for Revolutionary, Immutable, Public, Collaborative, Open, Resistant to censorship, Decentralised. 

Not your keys, not your coins – Use major crypto exchanges (kraken.com / binance.c­om / coinbase.com) like a public toilet service. You get in, you do your own business by buying your coins or tokens and then you get out by withdrawing your assets into cold storage hardware wallets like the most popular Ledger or Trezor at time of writing this. If you are really interested in getting some interests out of your assets, explore DEFI projects managed by DAOs. All other services that offer you interests must be seen as a possible red flag because usually involved the fact that you are giving them your private key of your coins or tokens. History teach us that services like that, like ex Blockfi, Celsius have been the source of problems of many investors which have lost control over their asset when they went bankrupt. DEFI projects like AAVE, Uniswap allow you to receive interest but maintaining ownership of your assets (most important lesson: “Your keys, your coins”). Learn about decentralised exchanges too.

Verify the nature of the projects – With a simple search on website like coingecko.com you find out about the code repositories or Source Code, which are the best place to prove the presence of a collaborative project, usually on github.com or gitlab.com. These show that the project is open source and so visible and open for reviews of all type. In the code repository look for recent activities, updates, look for a community of collaborative developers, look for suspicious presence of external forks from other projects, if the project has NOT been updated at all in the last 2 years, this could be a red flag. Read the project’s white paper and make sure it is not a replica of another one.

Transacting for the first time – The extra care you must have when transacting with someone for the first time is extremely important. Do not send all your coins or tokens to an address you never transact before. It’s always a caution decision to send first a little amount to prove to you and your receiver that communication is going into the right direction. Copy and paste sending and receiving address always never type single character after single character, use Qr-code scanner if possible. Make sure you are sending token of the same blockchain type and version. This last one can be a bit tricky but if you follow the steps above you won’t incur in any dodgy transaction. When moving crypto assets outside exchanges, make sure you are using a well know cold hardware wallet. 

Maintaining your positions – If and when you decide which will be your investment projects, and you have saved your crypto asset offline, it’s time to keep in touch with everything is happening with that community project. Subscribing to a social media account like twitter could be a good choice to keep up with development timelines and roadmaps. Having exposure on everything crypto related could help you to keep learning about the evolution of this field.
